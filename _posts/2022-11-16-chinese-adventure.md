I think I have to redesign my approach for conquering the Chinese. I mean conquering the mandarin. 

It has been almost 6 years since 2016. I have not been satisfied with all the achievements I've got. 

Then I rethinking it all. What's next?

Using [Anki ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387)app ([SRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)) gives me huge advantages in terms of memorizing Chinese words efficiently, as well as memorizing Chinese sentences. But it simply helped me nothing in terms of achieving my goal: reading Chinese books comfortably, taking Chinese convo peacefully. 

Then I look back to how I learned English in the past few years: I'm doing it by memorizing songs and chatting with a Palestinian friend. 

Unfortunately we can't learn mandarin just by using Chinese songs. Thanks to the tonal issue, it simply doesn't work that way.

What's next? What kind of other fun way, method, arts, or something else that I can explore by? 

Memorizing Chinese idioms?
