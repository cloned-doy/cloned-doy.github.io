How close really you are to the persons you admire with?

Yesterday, I met Mas Eddy for the first time. He informed me that he had retired from his job past few months prior. From the Astra group. 

Suddenly I ask him something ‘maybe basic’ but has deep personal meaning for me. I want to asked him about the founder of Astra group, William Soeryadjaya. I have read his biography.

I asked him “have u ever met Mr. William in person? Om William?”

He paused for a sec. Then he tell me stories, describing me how kind Om William is. Om William always tried to remember everyone’s name.

I just realized something. As time goes by, seems like I get closer to whoever I admire, started with some Indonesian tokoh whose biography I read.

Then days later I met one of my friend’s friend. She is a journalist, before she finally secured a LPDP scholarship and went to Sweden.

She tells stories about the pros and cons of being a journalist. One thing that I admired the most is the chances of meeting some orang penting. She said she has met Mr Ignatius Jonan, bu Risma, or even Mr Dahlan Iskan. 

Then I think, does she save the phone number of every person she told me?

then she answered ofc not all of them. Senior journalists perhaps have their phone number. but juniors like her may have to make an appointment with their secretary first. 

Whenever someone tells me that he/she has been met somebody I admire, I'm excited, secretly aspiring.

So far, I have read that info from youtube and books. And whenever someone in real life told the kind of story, its like one step closer to met the real person whom you admire for a long time.

months later I met the other tokoh of my admire lists: pak Dwi Soetjipto. 

I met him in Yogyakarta. sneaking into his ‘special’ meeting. During the meeting break I got the chance to talk with him, with a group of people, probably for 1 hour. I sat at the 2nd person away from him. Me, pak Yame, then pak Dwi himself.

At the end, I told him about pak Dahlan blogs, which years ago there was a special post about pak Dwi, when pak Dwi was the executive of Semen Indonesia. He smiled, and said “kemarin saya ketemu pak Dahlan di Jakarta. Kita abis bikin podcast bareng beliau, hehe”. 

Wow.
