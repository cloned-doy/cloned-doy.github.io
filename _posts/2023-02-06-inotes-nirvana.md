A friend of mine noticed that I was using iNotes on my Mozilla, and he commented, "Wow, you're literally utilizing all those iOS features!"

Hmm, I chose iNotes simply because it met my note-taking needs. I could dump ideas, write random questions, and organize my thoughts.

I don't have to deal with tedious buttons or unnecessary widgets that would waste space on my screen.

As an explorer who's willing to take risks to satisfy my own curiosity, I've experimented with various notetaking apps, such as Google Keep, Evernote, Simplenote, and even the Linux-based GNotes app. iNotes is my top pick due to its simplicity, usefulness, ease-of-use, cross-platform syncing, has auto backup features, and of course, it is free!

No ads, no subs plan. iNotes definitely takes the cake.

I used to think like _"Android could do the same things as iOS._ _Why would we spend extra money on the same tools?"_

I have calculated the cost per use of both iOS and Android devices and found out that the price are pretty similar. If you decided to use a pre-owned iOS device, the cost will be even lower.

Its like I am 'licking my own fallen saliva' right now.
