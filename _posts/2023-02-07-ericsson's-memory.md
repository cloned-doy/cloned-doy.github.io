I am learning how to type properly, utilizing all my ten fingers to type faster. 

The goal is to type more naturally and automatically without looking at the keyboard. It seems difficult at first, but the more I practice, the more I realize that my fingers are able to 'dance' automatically.

I am curious then, does our brain develop muscle memory the same way it memorizes words or numbers in school?

While we learning how to type which technically training our muscle memory, We got the chance to take a mini test to see if the remembering mechanism of 'blind typing' is the same as the brain's ordinary memorizing activity.

## **Moonwalking with Einstein**

In the past few years, I read a book titled "Moonwalking with Einstein" by Joshua Foer, which is about his journey as a journalist who managed to become the winner of the USA Memory Championships in 2006.

In the book, Foer raises some questions, such as: Are memory savants genetically special? Or are they just like us ordinary men, but with special tricks and techniques for remembering things?

These questions led him to meet Professor Anders Ericsson, a well-known researcher in the field of applied psychology who dedicated his career to studying human memory, including the savant syndrome phenomenon, with the goal of understanding how ordinary people like us can develop and train ourselves to remember better.

The rest of the book tells us about how these "mental athletes," memory savants, and other individuals remember things. The book explores how these unique individuals build personalized memorizing techniques and spend hours implementing and exercising their memory skills. They train themselves to remember almost anything, including thousands of phi digits, dozens of phone numbers, stacks of cards, or even words in a whole dictionary.

The memory techniques they developed have helped them to make their memories and remembering activities work like magic.

I feel grateful to have found this random book, which was dumped off at the corner of Pasar Wilis. It turned out to be a great book that suited my needs in learning Mandarin characters.

Hence, the truth is that remembering things is more of an art than a science.

## **OK Plateau**

Joshua Foer applied all the techniques and developed his personalized memory technique for himself. He managed to train himself in remembering cards, transforming from a slow rememberer to a faster memorist. Remembering things became an automatic activity for him, until one day he felt powerless to remember extra cards and felt stuck without knowing why. He felt he had lost his magic trick and sought help from Professor Ericsson.

The professor told him that the phenomenon Joshua faced is called the "OK plateau." When we acquire the ability to remember things easily, we tend to do it autonomously. The most frightening thing is that once we get trapped, it is challenging to remember extra cards, making it harder to go the extra mile.

We are more likely to get trapped in this mental trap too. Especially in keyboard blind typing. Amit-amit jabang bayi, I hope this never happens to me.

Don't panic, as Professor Ericsson said to Joshua Foer, there is one simple way to avoid hitting the OK plateau. Just set a higher bar for ourselves and continue to push ourselves to improve by going beyond that bar.

If we feel comfortable remembering 100 cards in 60 seconds, try to make it faster, say 45 seconds, and push ourselves to the extra bar. This is how we can save ourselves from the OK plateau and stretch our brain plasticity.

That's it!

I am enjoying my journey of learning how to type faster and correctly, but Professor Ericsson's words keep haunting my mind. I don't want to be trapped in the OK plateau. I want to fly faster and faster, and higher.

PS: As I finish writing this, I have just learned that Professor Anders Ericsson passed away in 2020. I strongly recommend that you read his papers to see how productive he was. 

May God bless him.
